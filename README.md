# Functions 

- Saving work with functions
- Function arguments

A **function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a functionn, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "call" the function by name.

The name of the function is a type. The expression in parenthesis is called the **argument** of the function. It is common to say that a function "takes" an argument and "returns" a result. The result is also called the **return value**. 

A **function definition** specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called. 

The first line of the function defintion is called the **header**; the rest is called the **body**. Defining a function creates a **function object**, a value created by a function defintion. The name of the function is a variable that refers to a function object. 

A **parameter**: A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument. 

A **traceback**: A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs. 

``print(print_lyrics)
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>
``

# Continuing Functions

- Refactor functions
- Keyword arguments and default arguments

**refactoring**: The process of modifying a working program to improve functions interfaces and other qualities of the code.
