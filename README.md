# Functions 

- Saving work with functions
- Function arguments

A **function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a functionn, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "call" the function by name.

The name of the function is a type. The expression in parenthesis is called the **argument** of the function. It is common to say that a function "takes" an argument and "returns" a result. The result is also called the **return value**. 

A **function definition** specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called. 

The first line of the function defintion is called the **header**; the rest is called the **body**. Defining a function creates a **function object**, a value created by a function defintion. The name of the function is a variable that refers to a function object. 

A **parameter**: A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument. 

A **traceback**: A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs. 

``print(print_lyrics)
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>
``

# Continuing Functions

- Refactor functions
- Keyword arguments and default arguments

**refactoring**: The process of modifying a working program to improve functions interfaces and other qualities of the code. 


# APIs and REST

 - Instant Data
 - APIs in four lines
 - Understanding URLs
 - Exploring URLs lab
 - Developer tools with APIs
 - Requests and responses
 
We went over the Google Books API and how it works. The main takeaway was to understand how and where to start the query in a URL. It will usually start with `?.`


# APIs and Python

- Query parameters lab
- Calling APIs with Python

# Foursquare API

- Signing up for an API
- Navigating the Foursquare API
- Foursquare methods

# Spotify API

Even though this wasn't part of the lab, I did come upon a probelm that I would like highlighed. They're called nested dictionaries. View this YouTube video called [Python - Accessing Nested Dictionnary Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQfNYqz8pLs). It does a really good job of explaining how to access values from nested dictionaries. 

Apparently you can do a lot with the `import json` package. Check out this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lxrb_ezP-g) titled "How to Write Python Scripts to Analyze JSON APIs and and if you have a lot of extra time you would watch this

Mass assignment - we need to first learn: `setattr` (set attribute) method and access keyword arguments in Python.
